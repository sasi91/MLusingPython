<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<p> Based on our analysis, we came up with below observations. </p>
<div>
<h4> Questions </h4>
<ol>
<li>What is the overall survival rates?</li>
<li> Which year has the maximum number of surgeries?</li>
<li> Which year has lowest success rate in surgeries?</li>
<li> Does the age factor decide the survival chance?</li>
<li> Does the axillary nodes decide the survival chance?</li>
<li> Which age group has high Survival rate?</li>
<li> What % of Short survival patients having zero nodes?</li>
</ol>
